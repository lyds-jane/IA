Definition of the Problem
---
Maggie Downer is creating an educational program to teach young people about FNAI culture in Canada. She is looking for a website that can both advertise and run the program. Additionally, since Ms. Downer is not finished developing the course, she wants to be able to edit and change the information on the website at any time after the development is complete.

Rational for Proposed Solution
--
Since I will be creating a website, I will use a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to fulfill my client's needs. In order to for the website to serve its dual purpose, I will create a webiste with two parts; a public site that has information about the program and contact information, and a login-protected site that has all of the course modules. In order to give the client the ability to continue editing the information after development, she will have an administrator's login that will let her add and change modules as necesssary. 

Success Criteria
--
Since the client has no previous experience with website development; I decided to create two sets of success criteria. I created the main one for the client, that was more focused on user-based needs, and did not go in-depth into the computer science 

After discussing the product with the client over the phone, I developped the following success criteria: 

* The main site is public and accessible and will have the following pages:
  * Description of the program (an outline of how the program works and what is included)
  * About the program (history & inspiration)
  * Contact us (the team behind the program, individual contact information, & a main contact box)
  * Register (the opportunity to register for the program)
* The main website will have a portal for registered students to login
* The private site will open on a seperate tab after logging in, and will have a member's view and an administrator's view (based on the login)
  * The member's view will have the following:
    * The program's modules
    * A function showing how much progress they have completed
  * The administrator's view will have:
    * The program's modules with the ability to edit and delete modules
    * The ability to add modules that:
      * Contain a title, a brief description, and text
      * Have multiple steps and the ability to save progress at the end of a step
      * Can include photos and videos
      * Can include links
  * An option to edit the text and photos of the main website
* The website works in its full capacity, all internal links and buttons function, and it is all laid out in a clear, comprehensive manner.
